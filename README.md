# velib

### There are two branches in this reposities:
**first branche "master":**

There is a main folder Velib, it contains three parts in this folder, a folder "Host" who containes the intermediary Web service (IWS) in folder "host", a folder "Client" whoe contains client-side, a folder "MonitoringClient" who contains a monitor to supervise the IWS, i put these three folder in folder "velib", to compile these codes you need to create new WCF project in VS for "Host" and "Client", and a winform project for "MonitoringClient".

It provide four functions in my project:

1. A user interface which provide three button "Get Citys", "Get City", "Get Station".

3. Asynchronous methods in both IWS and client-side, IWS use asynchronous methods to reduce the comminication time between IWS and https://api.jcdecaux.com/, client-side use asynchronous methods to reduce the time between client-side and IWS.
